# Application Overview

This mobile app connects **car owners** with **advertising companies**, allowing drivers to earn money by promoting ads on their vehicles.

Drivers get paid for meeting campaign requirements like monthly mileage and geographic coverage. Companies get access to real-time campaign performance, reach analytics, and a pool of available drivers.

The app supports two primary roles:

- **Car Owners** who want to earn extra income by driving with ads.
- **Companies** that want to promote their brand through on-vehicle advertising.
